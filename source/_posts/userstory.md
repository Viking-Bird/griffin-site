# Crawler 

 > The Crawler produces data according to passed in seed urls and extraction configuration. 
 > There could be a couple of dimensions of Data Quality which should be highlighted:

 * Data Completeness
 * Data Freshness

## Data Completeness(accuracy)

### Problem

Crawler needs a set of metrics to evaluate its data completeness.
Data Completeness is used to indicate whether every URL fed into crawler has its valid response in a reasonable duration.
 * if an URL has its corresponding response, called mapped URL.
 * Data Completeness is a ratio: the number unmapped URL compared with total number of URLs in a certain time window.
 * The time window is measured based on the time window of input.

### Challenge

The input/output could be more complicated in crawler:
 * Batch & Streaming & batch-in-streaming-out: the input/output could be in HDFS & Kafka & Mongo
 * Normal Crawling & Depth Crawling


### Trouble Shooting

Griffin will mark and record all the unmatched rows, so that further trouble shooting could begin with this.
Get back to streaming case, the retention time have to be extended so that trouble shooting can go with it.

### Solution

#### Streaming + normal crawling
In such a case, all the input URLs are submitted into Kafka, and all the responses are written back to Kafka (different topic). 
So the Data Completeness of this case is pretty easy to define:

1.	for a given time window, 
2.	every URL submitted into kafka
3.	should be able to have an response in a certain duration.
4.	The ratio: number_of_URLs_without_response / number_of_all_URLs

#### Griffin will work in this way:
1.	create 2 connector, input/output consumer, which read data from kafka
2.	in a certain time window, for any given URL of input,
	* griffin searches the corresponding response in output topic of kafka
	* if found, pick next one
	* if not found, try again later, until a given time duration time out.
	* calculate the ratio, markdown the unmapped URLs
3.	output consumer will persist the response data to HDFS. This is to optimize the memory usage, since we donâ€™t want to keep a giant number of data in memory.
4.	push the DQ results back to griffin DB, so that the service can offer retrieve service, and front end can show the metrics.

#### Crawler integration

Crawler should have its own dashboard, which call the griffin service and render the metrics.
