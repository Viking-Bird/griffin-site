## Plan

#### 2017.04 batch accuracy onboard


- Week01: headless batch accuracy measure
  * headless batch accuracy measure use case onboard.
  * headless batch accuracy measure usage document.

- Week02: batch accuracy measure with service
  * release batch accuracy measure with service enabled. 
  * end2end headless workable use case, including guidance, metrics report. 
  * prepare data in hive, explore data asset from ui, generate accuracy measure in ui, trigger accuracy measure in script.

- Week03: batch accuracy measure with UI Page
  * UI Page refine: remove 'create data asset' 
  * end2end ui enabled workable use case. 
  * prepare data in hive, explore data asset from ui, generate accuracy measure in ui, trigger accuracy measure in script.

- Week04: release batch accuracy measure with UI, Service, Scheduler, Measure.
  * end to end full pipeline use case enabled.
