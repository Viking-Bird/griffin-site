## Propose an improvement or a new feature

Our community is constantly looking for feedback to improve Apache Griffin. If you have an idea how to improve Griffin or have a new feature in mind that would be beneficial for Griffin users, please open an issue in Griffin’s JIRA. The improvement or new feature should be described in appropriate detail and include the scope and its requirements if possible.

We recommend to first reach consensus with the community on whether a new feature is required and how to implement a new feature, before starting with the implementation.

## How to become a committer

Committers are community members that have write access to the project’s repositories, i.e., they can modify the code, documentation, and website by themselves and also accept other contributions.

There is no strict protocol for becoming a committer. Candidates for new committers are typically people that are active contributors and community members.

Being an active community member means participating on mailing list discussions, helping to answer questions, verifying release candidates, being respectful towards others, and following the meritocratic principles of community management. Since the “Apache Way” has a strong focus on the project community, this part is very important.

Of course, contributing code and documentation to the project is important as well. A good way to start is contributing improvements, new features, or bug fixes. You need to show that you take responsibility for the code that you contribute, add tests and documentation, and help maintaining it.

Candidates for new committers are suggested by current committers or PMC members, and voted upon by the PMC.

If you would like to become a committer, you should engage with the community and start contributing to Apache Griffin in any of the above ways. You might also want to talk to other committers and ask for their advice and guidance.
